##ABSTRACT:
***

The project we made is known as vr flight simulator.It is a simulation of real life plane experience.
In this project We had used a ultrasonic sensor, a bump sensor, a potentiometer sensor, a gyroscope
sensor (esp8266), and a esp9250 module to make a joystick and a throttle handle. The joytick physically
moved in vertical circular motion in left write direction, and it moved front and backwards producing 
respective motion in game. The throttles went front and backwards to accelerate and decelerate the plane
respectively.

##MOTIVATION:
***

Our motivation for doing this project was the creativity of the idea and our fascination with the end result.

##COST STRUCTURE:
***

1. Mechanical 
 *welding : rs 70
 *ply     : rs 300
 *wire    : rs 200
 
2. Electrical
 *esp8266 module       : rs 500
 *ultrasonic sensor    : rs 100
 *bump sensor          : rs 20
 *potentiometer sensor : rs 50

##APPLICATIONS:
***

It can used for real life pilot training. It can also be used as a game for mass selling. 

##LIMITATIONS:
***

There was a slight noticable delay in rotation of joystick and its effect on screen, due to a long method of transmission of signal.
The system also failed on end days so its durablity can be improved.

##FUTURE IMPROVMENTS:
***

The delay of joystick rotation to its result can be decreased by using a short way of giving a signal to software.
Some software improvments can be done such as adding of distance from mountain (or building) in front, or if the plane is losing stability.
